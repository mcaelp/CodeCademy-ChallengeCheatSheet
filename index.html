        <h2>Flow of HTML</h2>
        <p>
          A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS
          from left to right, top to bottom, in the same order as they exist in
          the document. This is called the flow of elements in HTML. In addition
          to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS
          includes properties that change how a browser positions elements.
          These properties specify where an element is located on a page, if the
          element can share lines with other elements, and other related
          attributes.
        </p>
        <article>
          There are five properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements
          in the browser: <em>position</em>, <em>display</em>, <em>z-index</em>,
          <em>float</em>, <em>clear</em>. Each of these properties will allow us
          to position and view elements on a web page. They can be used in
          conjunction with any other styling properties.
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="position">
        <h2>Position</h2>
        <p>
          The default position of an element can be changed by setting its
          position property. The position property can take one of five values:
          <em>static</em> - the default value (it does not need to be
          specified), <em>relative</em>, <em>absolute</em>, <em>fixed</em>,
          <em>sticky</em>.

            <tr>
              <td class="tabletitle" id="static">Static</td>
              <td>
                The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the
                document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties
                have no effect. This is the default value.

              <td>
                Relative positioning in HTML/CSS refers to a method of placing
                an element relative to its normal position in the document flow,
                without affecting the position of other elements. When an
                element is relatively positioned, it can be shifted using the
                top, bottom, left, and right properties. These properties
                determine the offset of the element from its initial position,
                allowing for precise adjustments. Relative positioning is often
                used in conjunction with absolute positioning or other
                positioning techniques to create complex layouts or effects on a
                webpage.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tabletitle" id="absolute">Absolute</td>
              <td>
                Absolute positioning in HTML/CSS involves positioning an element
                relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor element
                that is set to a position other than the default static). If
                there is no positioned ancestor, the element is positioned
                relative to the initial containing block, typically the 'body'
                element. Absolute positioning removes the element from the
                normal document flow, so it doesn't affect the layout of other
                elements. The positioning of an element can be defined using the
                top, bottom, left, and right properties. This technique is
                commonly used to precisely place elements on a webpage or to
                create overlays, pop-up menus, or other dynamic content.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tabletitle" id="fixed">Fixed</td>
              <td>
                Fixed positioning in HTML/CSS involves positioning an element
                relative to the browser window or the viewport. Unlike absolute
                positioning, which is relative to the nearest positioned
                ancestor, fixed positioning is always relative to the viewport,
                regardless of scrolling. Fixed-positioned elements are removed
                from the normal document flow, so they don't affect the layout
                of other elements. The position of a fixed element can be
                defined using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. This
                technique is commonly used for creating elements such as
                navigation bars, headers, or advertisements that remain in a
                fixed position on the screen even when the user scrolls the
                page.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tabletitle" id="sticky">Sticky</td>
              <td>
                Sticky positioning in HTML/CSS is a hybrid between relative and
                fixed positioning. It allows an element to be positioned
                relative to its normal position in the document flow until a
                specified scroll point is reached, at which point it becomes
                fixed to a certain position in the viewport. Sticky positioning
                is achieved by setting the 'position: sticky;' property on an
                element and specifying the offset at which it becomes fixed
                using top, bottom, left, or right properties. Sticky positioning
                is commonly used for headers, navigation bars, or sidebars that
                remain visible as the user scrolls down the page, providing
                convenient access to important content or navigation options.

      <section id="zindex">
        <h2>Z-Index</h2>
        <p>
          The "z-index" property in HTML/CSS controls the stacking order of
          positioned elements on a webpage along the z-axis, which is
          perpendicular to both the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical).
          Essentially, it determines which elements are displayed in front of or
          behind others. A higher z-index value brings an element closer to the
          viewer (in front of other elements), while a lower value places it
          further away (behind other elements). If elements have the same
          z-index, the stacking order is determined by their order in the HTML
          document. For the "z-index" property to work, an element must have a
          position value other than "static" (such as "relative", "absolute", or
          "fixed"). It's commonly used to control the layering of elements in
          complex layouts, such as dropdown menus, modal windows, or overlapping
          sections of a webpage.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="display">
        <h2>Display</h2>
        <p>
          The "display" property in HTML/CSS controls how an element is rendered
          in the document layout. It specifies the type of box used for an HTML
          element and affects its visibility and behavior within the document
          flow.
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <th>Display</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tabletitle" id="inline">Inline</td>
              <td>
                The "inline" value for the "display" property in HTML/CSS causes
                the element to generate an inline-level box. This means the
                element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much
                width as necessary, allowing other inline elements to flow
                alongside it within the same line of text. Elements with
                "display: inline" behave similarly to words or phrases within a
                paragraph. They do not create a line break before or after
                themselves and can be considered part of the surrounding text
                flow. Examples of elements commonly set to "display: inline"
                include 'span', 'a', 'strong', 'em', and 'img'. This property is
                useful when you want elements to appear side by side
                horizontally, such as creating a navigation menu with links or
                displaying a series of inline icons.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tabletitle" id="block">Block</td>
              <td>
                The "block" value for the "display" property in HTML/CSS causes
                the element to generate a block-level box. This means the
                element starts on a new line and takes up the full width
                available, extending the entire width of its containing element
                by default. Elements with "display: block" do not allow other
                elements to sit alongside them on the same line; they create a
                new line before and after themselves. They are often used for
                elements that are intended to form standalone sections of
                content, such as paragraphs, headings, divs, and list items
                'li'. This property is useful when you want elements to stack
                vertically, with each element taking up its own line in the
                document layout. It's commonly used for structuring the main
                content of a webpage or for creating larger, self-contained
                sections of content.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tabletitle" id="inline_block">Inline-Block</td>
              <td>
                The "inline-block" value for the "display" property in HTML/CSS
                combines aspects of both "inline" and "block" elements. Elements
                with "display: inline-block" generate an inline-level box,
                meaning they can sit alongside other elements on the same line,
                similar to inline elements. However, they also behave like
                block-level elements in terms of layout, allowing you to specify
                width, height, margins, and padding, and they start on a new
                line when necessary. This property is particularly useful when
                you want elements to flow horizontally like inline elements but
                also want to control their dimensions and spacing like
                block-level elements. It's commonly used for elements like
                buttons, images, or containers that need to be positioned inline
                but still have block-level styling properties applied to them.

      </section>
      <section id="float">
        <h2>Float</h2>
        <p>
          The "float" property in HTML/CSS is used to specify whether an element
          should be floated to the left or right of its containing element,
          allowing content to flow around it. When an element is floated, it is
          taken out of the normal document flow and moved to the left or right
          side of its containing element, with other content wrapping around it.
          Common values for the "float" property are: "left": Floats the element
          to the left, allowing content to flow around its right side. "right":
          Floats the element to the right, allowing content to flow around its
          left side. "none": Default value, meaning the element does not float
          and appears in the normal document flow. "inherit": Inherits the float
          behavior from its parent element. Floating elements are often used for
          creating layouts where text or other content wraps around images, or
          for creating multi-column layouts by floating elements side by side.
          However, it's important to note that floating elements can sometimes
          lead to layout issues, such as collapsing parent containers or
          overlapping content, so it's essential to use them carefully and
          consider alternative layout techniques like flexbox or CSS grid where
          appropriate. Additionally, the use of floats for layout is becoming
          less common with the introduction of newer layout techniques in CSS.

      </section>
      <section id="clear">
        <h2>Clear</h2>
        <p>
          The "clear" property in HTML/CSS is used to control the behavior of
          elements that are affected by floated elements. When an element is
          cleared, it ensures that it appears below any floated elements that
          precede it in the document flow. Common values for the "clear"
          property are: "none": Default value, meaning the element is not
          cleared and can be positioned alongside floated elements. "left": The
          element clears any floated elements on the left side, ensuring it
          appears below them. "right": The element clears any floated elements
          on the right side, ensuring it appears below them. "both": The element
          clears floated elements on both the left and right sides, ensuring it
          appears below them regardless of their position. The "clear" property
          is often used in conjunction with floated elements to ensure proper
          layout and prevent elements from overlapping or being affected by
          floating content. It's commonly used in scenarios such as clearing
          floats before starting a new section of content or ensuring that
          elements in a multi-column layout stack correctly.
